\section{Introduction}

Validation of sea-ice models with observational data is an important part of the model development process. One such validation is the comparison of sea-ice model output with satellite thickness measurements. Here we describe a method of comparing DEMSI model output with ICESat laser altimetry data. Instead of using gridded thickness data products, we propose to directly compare satellite measured freeboard along individual satellite tracks, using what is termed a satellite emulator.

\section{ICESat Input Data}

Input satellite track data consists of a series of points consisting of latitude and longitude of the point, time of the satellite overpass, and the measured freeboard. The satellite dataset consists of ?? points per day/month.
